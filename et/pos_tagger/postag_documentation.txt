First, the POS Tagger uses an input.
The input comes from the previous module, which is the tokenizer.
The POS tagger uses TextBlob to extract the trained corpus of Penn Treebank.
The corpus was trained using the AveragePerceptron algorithm.
Average Perceptron algorithm gets the weights and features then average the result.
For more technical detail about the algorithm, just search it on Google. Thanks xx.
For reference, see the Penn Treebank txt file inside the folder.
The input must be a list of sentences that are tokenized.
After tagging, the punctuations will be tagged from the list.
There is no need to install dependencies.


Explanation for every file in this directory only.
The test_debugging.py is the file that you will run.
The preprocess.py contains the preprocessing of splitting of every words inside the input file and the removal and deletion of other unnecessary details.
The pos_tagger.py contains the assertion of the format, tagging of parts-of-speech and punctuation.
The others are the imported files for POS tagging.
